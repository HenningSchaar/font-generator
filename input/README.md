# Font Generator Input Instructions

This directory is for placing the image files that will be processed to create a font. 

## Instructions:

1. Prepare your PNG or BMP files:
   - Ensure that the files are named using uppercase and lowercase letters (e.g., "A.png", "a.png", "B.png", "b.png", etc.).
   - The images should contain black lines on a white background.

2. Place your image files in this directory (`input`).

3. Run the font generation script to process the images and create the font.

Make sure to follow the naming conventions and image requirements for optimal results.
